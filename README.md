These are my solutions, written in Java, using IntelliJ.

## How to build and run

Install maven. Run `mvn package appassembler:assemble` to build the application.

Run the main program, supplying the classname you want to run as the argument:  

```sh
target/appassembler/bin/aoc2024 Day01Puzzle01
```

The input files in `src/main/resources` are encrypted. If you're not me, you'll need
to download the input files yourself from the AoC website and replace the encrypted ones
in that directory.
